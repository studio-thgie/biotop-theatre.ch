## How to viwew pages

You need to enter the page name in the address bar.

For example:

```
http://my-ip:8000/about.html
```

### Dev process
There is an `index.html` file that shows the contents of your dev env (i.e. a pretty server listing).

This file doesn't get built.

## How to load assets

### HTML assets

Assets loaded from build/assets where build is the root:

```
<img src="assets/images/my-image.png" alt="">
```

Loading vendor CSS or JS:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/vendor/my-style.css" type="text/css" media="all" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/vendor/my-script.js"></script>
```

### CSS assets

Fonts start from build with a slash (/):

```
url('/assets/fonts/my-font.woff') format('woff');
```

The path for CSS background images start from assets as well.

```
background: url(/assets/images/images/temp/logo.png) 0 0 no-repeat;
```

### AJAX assets

Use `./` in your local AJAX URLs.

```
<a href="./ajax/popup.html" class="js-popup">Popup</a>
```
